# Installation

Using **vim-plug**:

```vim
Plug 'vimpostor/vim-tpipeline'
```

It is **highly recommended** to put this in your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
set -g focus-events on
set -g status-style bg=default
set -g status-left-length 99
set -g status-right-length 99
set -g status-justify centre
```

Restart tmux and now you should see your vim statusline inside tmux.

`vim-tpipeline` is compatible with all statuslines and can be used together with other statusline plugins like *lightline*. If it doesn't work with yours, file a bug report.

## Requirements

- Vim 8.2.4650 (or higher) OR Neovim 0.6 (or higher)
- True color support (`set termguicolors` in vim)
- For best experience use a terminal that supports [focus events](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h3-FocusIn_FocusOut) (Known good terminals are `wezterm`, `konsole` and `iTerm2`)

# Configuration

This plugin will automatically embed your statusline in tmux with sane defaults.
If you want to have more control over where it is placed, disable the autoconfiguration with `g:tpipeline_autoembed` and embed the statusline manually, here is one example:

```vim
" .vimrc
" You can also use Lua for configuration, see :h lua-vim-variables for help
let g:tpipeline_autoembed = 0
```

```bash
# .tmux.conf
set -g focus-events on
set -g status-style bg=default
set -g status-left '#(cat #{socket_path}-\#{session_id}-vimbridge)'
set -g status-left-length 99
set -g status-right '#(cat #{socket_path}-\#{session_id}-vimbridge-R)'
set -g status-right-length 99
set -g status-justify centre
```

By default `vim-tpipeline` will copy your standard vim `statusline`.
If you want to use a different statusline just for tmux, you can set it manually:

```vim
" tpipeline comes bundled with its own custom minimal statusline
let g:tpipeline_statusline = '%!tpipeline#stl#line()'
" You can also use standard statusline syntax, see :help stl
let g:tpipeline_statusline = '%f'
```

There are many more options available to accomodate for every specific usecase. Check them out in the comprehensive help file using `:help tpipeline-configure`.

# FAQ

## But why?

Usually there is plenty of empty space available in your tmux statusline, hence you make much better use of your space if you put your vim statusline there.
After all you don't want to have your carefully handcrafted vim config end up as a bad Internet Explorer meme, do you?

## Can I use the default *tpipeline statusline* outside of tmux as well?

Yes, use `set stl=%!tpipeline#stl#line()` in your `~/.vimrc`. In fact this plugin uses *Vim*'s autoload mechanism to lazily load features, i.e. if you don't use tmux, you can still use the statusline inside vim without loading unnecessary features.

## Focus events are not working for me in tmux

Besides putting `set -g focus-events on` in your `tmux` config, you also need to have the `XT`-capability available, which you can test by issuing the `tput XT` command. If the capability is not present inside tmux, then there are three ways to fix the [issue](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2606):

- Put `set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"` in your `tmux` config.
- Force vim to enable it by using this in your `.vimrc`
```vim
let &t_fe = "\<Esc>[?1004h"
let &t_fd = "\<Esc>[?1004l"
```
- Write your own custom terminfo entry based on *tmux-256color*

## How do I stop the centered window list from flickering when changing panes?

[Since tmux version 3.2](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/3eb91efba160eff0b077a5fee902edb632f7fdca) you can use `absolute-centre` instead of `centre`:
```diff
-set -g status-justify centre
+set -g status-justify absolute-centre
```

## Why should I use this plugin over [onestatus](https://github.com/narajaon/onestatus)?

- In `onestatus` the tmux statusline is updated using a blocking call, whereas `tpipeline` uses non-blocking jobs to asynchronously update the statusline.
- `tpipeline` works out of the box with your current vim statusline, whereas `onestatus` does not actually use your statusline at all and requires you to configure its own statusline.
- As a result of the above, `onestatus` isn't able to use many vim features such as your vim colorscheme and requires you to redefine your colors. In `tpipeline`, vim colors are translated to tmux syntax automatically.
- Simple things such as showing your current mode or linenumber require writing your own function in `onestatus`. In `tpipeline` this works out of the box.
